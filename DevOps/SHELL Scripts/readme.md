100 Shell Script Examples:=============>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

A shell script in Linux is a text file containing a sequence of commands written in a scripting language interpreted by the shell. The shell acts as an interface between the user and the operating system, interpreting commands entered by the user or read from a script file. The GNU Bourne-Again Shell also known as bash is the default shell for most of the Linux distributions. It commonly runs in its interactive form which is the Command Line Interface (CLI).

Shell scripts are primarily written in scripting languages like Bash (Bourne Again SHell), sh (Bourne Shell), C Shell, Korn Shell (ksh), and others. Among these, Bash is the default shell for most Linux distributions. The very first line of a bash script needs to start with the SheBang (#!) followed by the path to the bash executable program (/bin/bash).
